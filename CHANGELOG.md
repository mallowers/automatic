# Change Log for SD.Next

## Update for 06/11/2023

- updated ui labels and hints to improve clarity and provide some extra info  
  this is 1st stage of the process, more to come...  
  if you want to join the effort, see <https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/discussions/1246>
- new localization and hints engine  
- reworked **installer** sequence  
  as some extensions are loading packages directly from their preload sequence  
  which was preventing some optimizations to take effect  
- updated **settings** tab functionality, thanks @gegell  
- **launcher** will now warn if application owned files are modified  
- add more profiling for scripts/extensions so you can see what takes time  
  this applies both to initial load as well as execution  
- experimental `sd_model_dict` setting which allows you to load model dictionary  
  from one model and apply weights from another model specified in `sd_model_checkpoint`  
  results? who am i to judge :)

## Update for 06/05/2023

Few new features and extra handling for broken extensions  
that caused my phone to go crazy with notifications over the weekend...

- added extra networks to **xyz grid** options  
  now you can have more fun with all your embeddings and loras :)  
- new **vae decode** method to help with larger batch sizes, thanks @bigdog  
- new setting -> lora -> **use lycoris to handle all lora types**  
  this is still experimental, but the goal is to obsolete old built-in lora module  
  as it doesn't understand many new loras and built-in lyco module can handle it all  
- somewhat optimize browser page loading  
  still slower than i'd want, but gradio is pretty bad at this  
- profiling of scripts/extensions callbacks  
  you can now see how much or pre/post processing is done, not just how long generate takes  
- additional exception handling so bad exception does not crash main app  
- additional background removal models  
- some work on bfloat16 which nobody really should be using, but why not ðŸ™‚


## Update for 06/02/2023

Some quality-of-life improvements while working on larger stuff in the background...

- redesign action box to be uniform accross all themes  
- add **pause** option next to stop/skip  
- redesigned progress bar  
- add new built-in extension: **agent-scheduler**  
  very elegant way to getting full queing capabilies, thank @artventurdev  
- enable more image formats  
  note: not all are understood by browser so previews and images may appear as blank  
  unless you have some browser extensions that can handle them  
  but they are saved correctly. and cant beat raw quality of 32-bit `tiff` or `psd` :)  
- change in behavior: `xformers` will be uninstalled on startup if they are not active  
  if you do have `xformers` selected as your desired cross-optimization method, then they will be used  
  reason is that a lot of libaries try to blindy import xformers even if they are not selected or not functional  

## Update for 05/30/2023

Another bigger one...And more to come in the next few days...

- new live preview mode: taesd  
  i really like this one, so its enabled as default for new installs  
- settings search feature  
- new sampler: sde++ 2m sde  
- fully common save/zip/delete (new) options in all tabs  
  which (again) meant rework of process image tab  
- system info tab: live gpu utilization/memory graphs for nvidia gpus  
- updated controlnet interface  
- minor style changes  
- updated lora, swinir, scunet and ldsr code from upstream  
- start of merge from a1111 v1.3  

## Update for 05/26/2023

Some quality-of-life improvements...

- updated [README](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/blob/master/README.md)
- created [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)  
  this will be the source for all info about new things moving forward  
  and cross-posted to [Discussions#99](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/discussions/99) as well as discord [announcements](https://discord.com/channels/1101998836328697867/1109953953396957286)
- optimize model loading on startup  
  this should reduce startup time significantly  
- set default cross-optimization method for each platform backend  
  applicable for new installs only  
  - `cuda` => Scaled-Dot-Product
  - `rocm` => Sub-quadratic
  - `directml` => Sub-quadratic
  - `ipex` => InvokeAI's
  - `mps` => Doggettx's
  - `cpu` => Doggettx's
- optimize logging  
- optimize profiling  
  now includes startup profiling as well as `cuda` profiling during generate  
- minor lightbox improvements  
- bugfixes...i don't recall when was a release with at least several of those  

other than that - first stage of [Diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) integration is now in master branch  
i don't recommend anyone to try it (and dont even think reporting issues for it)  
but if anyone wants to contribute, take a look at [project page](https://github.com/users/vladmandic/projects/1/views/1)

## Update for 05/23/2023

Major internal work with perhaps not that much user-facing to show for it ;)

- update core repos: **stability-ai**, **taming-transformers**, **k-diffusion, blip**, **codeformer**  
  note: to avoid disruptions, this is applicable for new installs only
- tested with **torch 2.1**, **cuda 12.1**, **cudnn 8.9**  
  (production remains on torch2.0.1+cuda11.8+cudnn8.8)  
- fully extend support of `--data-dir`  
  allows multiple installations to share pretty much everything, not just models  
  especially useful if you want to run in a stateless container or cloud instance  
- redo api authentication  
  now api authentication will use same user/pwd (if specified) for ui and strictly enforce it using httpbasicauth  
  new authentication is also fully supported in combination with ssl for both sync and async calls  
  if you want to use api programatically, see examples in `cli/sdapi.py`  
- add dark/light theme mode toggle  
- redo some `clip-skip` functionality  
- better matching for vae vs model  
- update to `xyz grid` to allow creation of large number of images without creating grid itself  
- update `gradio` (again)  
- more prompt parser optimizations  
- better error handling when importing image settings which are not compatible with current install  
  for example, when upscaler or sampler originally used is not available  
- fixes...amazing how many issues were introduced by porting a1111 v1.20 code without adding almost no new functionality  
  next one is v1.30 (still in dev) which does bring a lot of new features  

## Update for 05/17/2023

This is a massive one due to huge number of changes,  
but hopefully it will go ok...

- new **prompt parsers**  
  select in UI -> Settings -> Stable Diffusion  
  - **Full**: my new implementation  
  - **A1111**: for backward compatibility  
  - **Compel**: as used in ComfyUI and InvokeAI (a.k.a *Temporal Weighting*)  
  - **Fixed**: for really old backward compatibility  
- monitor **extensions** install/startup and  
  log if they modify any packages/requirements  
  this is a *deep-experimental* python hack, but i think its worth it as extensions modifying requirements  
  is one of most common causes of issues
- added `--safe` command line flag mode which skips loading user extensions  
  please try to use it before opening new issue  
- reintroduce `--api-only` mode to start server without ui  
- port *all* upstream changes from [A1111](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)  
  up to today - commit hash `89f9faa`  

## Update for 05/15/2023

- major work on **prompt parsing**
  this can cause some differences in results compared to what you're used to, but its all about fixes & improvements
  - prompt parser was adding commas and spaces as separate words and tokens and/or prefixes
  - negative prompt weight using `[word:weight]` was ignored, it was always `0.909`
  - bracket matching was anything but correct. complex nested attention brackets are now working.
  - btw, if you run with `--debug` flag, you'll now actually see parsed prompt & schedule
- updated all scripts in `/cli`  
- add option in settings to force different **latent sampler** instead of using primary only
- add **interrupt/skip** capabilities to process images

## Update for 05/13/2023

This is mostly about optimizations...

- improved `torch-directml` support  
  especially interesting for **amd** users on **windows**  where **torch+rocm** is not yet available  
  dont forget to run using `--use-directml` or default is **cpu**  
- improved compatibility with **nvidia** rtx 1xxx/2xxx series gpus  
- fully working `torch.compile` with **torch 2.0.1**  
  using `inductor` compile takes a while on first run, but does result in 5-10% performance increase  
- improved memory handling  
  for highest performance, you can also disable aggressive **gc** in settings  
- improved performance  
  especially *after* generate as image handling has been moved to separate thread  
- allow per-extension updates in extension manager  
- option to reset configuration in settings  

## Update for 05/11/2023

- brand new **extension manager**  
  this is pretty much a complete rewrite, so new issues are possible
- support for `torch` 2.0.1  
  note that if you are experiencing frequent hangs, this may be a worth a try  
- updated `gradio` to 3.29.0
- added `--reinstall` flag to force reinstall of all packages  
- auto-recover & re-attempt when `--upgrade` is requested but fails
- check for duplicate extensions  

## Update for 05/08/2023

Back online with few updates:

- bugfixes. yup, quite a lot of those  
- auto-detect some cpu/gpu capabilities on startup  
  this should reduce need to tweak and tune settings like no-half, no-half-vae, fp16 vs fp32, etc  
- configurable order of top level tabs  
- configurable order of scripts in txt2img and img2img  
  for both, see sections in ui-> settings -> user interface

## Update for 05/04/2023

Again, few days later...

- reviewed/ported **all** commits from **A1111** upstream  
  some a few are not applicable as i already have alternative implementations  
  and very few i choose not to implement (save/restore last-known-good-config is a bad hack)  
  otherwise, we're fully up to date (its doesn't show on fork status as code merges were mostly manual due to conflicts)  
  but...due to sheer size of the updates, this may introduce some temporary issues  
- redesigned server restart function  
  now available and working in ui  
  actually, since server restart is now a true restart and not ui restart, it can be used much more flexibly  
- faster model load  
  plus support for slower devices via stream-load function (in ui settings)  
- better logging  
  this includes new `--debug` flag for more verbose logging when troubleshooting  

## Update for 05/01/2023

Been a bit quieter for last few days as changes were quite significant, but finally here we are...

- Updated core libraries: Gradio, Diffusers, Transformers
- Added support for **Intel ARC** GPUs via Intel OneAPI IPEX (auto-detected)
- Added support for **TorchML** (set by default when running on non-compatible GPU or on CPU)
- Enhanced support for AMD GPUs with **ROCm**
- Enhanced support for Apple **M1/M2**
- Redesigned command params: run `webui --help` for details
- Redesigned API and script processing
- Experimental support for multiple **Torch compile** options
- Improved sampler support
- Google Colab: <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/126cDNwHfifCyUpCCQF9IHpEdiXRfHrLN>  
  Maintained by <https://github.com/Linaqruf/sd-notebook-collection>
- Fixes, fixes, fixes...

To take advantage of new out-of-the-box tunings, its recommended to delete your `config.json` so new defaults are applied. Its not necessary, but otherwise you may need to play with UI Settings to get the best of Intel ARC, TorchML, ROCm or Apple M1/M2.

## Update for 04/27/2023

a bit shorter list as:

- i've been busy with buxfixing  
  there are a lot of them, not going to list each here.  
  but seems like critical issues backlog is quieting down and soon i can focus on new features development.  
- i've started collaboration with couple of major projects,
  hopefully this will accelerate future development.

what's new:

- ability to view/add/edit model description shown in extra networks cards  
- add option to specify fallback sampler if primary sampler is not compatible with desired operation  
- make clip skip a local parameter  
- remove obsolete items from UI settings  
- set defaults for AMD ROCm  
  if you have issues, you may want to start with a fresh install so configuration can be created from scratch
- set defaults for Apple M1/M2  
  if you have issues, you may want to start with a fresh install so configuration can be created from scratch

## Update for 04/12/2023

This has been pending for a while, but finally uploaded some massive changes

- New launcher
  - `webui.bat` and `webui.sh`:  
    Platform specific wrapper scripts that starts `launch.py` in Python virtual environment  
    *Note*: Server can run without virtual environment, but it is recommended to use it  
    This is carry-over from original repo  
    **If you're unsure which launcher to use, this is the one you want**  
  - `launch.py`:  
    Main startup script  
    Can be used directly to start server in manually activated `venv` or to run it without `venv`  
  - `installer.py`:  
    Main installer, used by `launch.py`  
  - `webui.py`:  
    Main server script  
- New logger
- New exception handler
- Built-in performance profiler
- New requirements handling
- Move of most of command line flags into UI Settings
